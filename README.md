# Samurai Standoff

Samurai Standoff is a 2D tower defense game that offers engaging gameplay mechanics deeply rooted in Japanese mythology. Players will strategically build, upgrade, and deploy various attack units inspired by historical Japanese warriors, such as samurai, archers, and ninjas, to fend off waves of mythical enemies including Yokai, Oni, and Tengu.
The game is based on the arcade style, that means if the player's health is 0, then he has to start the game all over again.
