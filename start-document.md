<h3> What is a Tower Defense game </h3>
The tower defense genre is a subgenre of strategy video games that revolves 
around defending a designated area, typically a base or a path, from waves
of incoming enemies.

often referred to as "towers," along the enemies' path to obstruct, damage, or 
eliminate them before they reach their objective.
Each tower has unique abilities, strengths, and weaknesses, requiring players 
to carefully plan their strategy and make tactical decisions to counter different 
enemy types. As players progress, they earn in-game resources to upgrade or purchase 
new towers, enhancing their defenses against increasingly challenging enemy waves.
Tower defense games are known for their addictive gameplay, strategic depth,
