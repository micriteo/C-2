<h2> Introduction </h2>

In 16th century Japan during the Sengoku period, Daimyo X was a powerful lord tasked with stopping a skilled general named Sei Shapu and his army from conquering his castle.

The shogun had no choice but to release her unharmed, and X married her in a grand wedding. Taro was hailed as a hero among his people for his bravery and cunning.


<h3> Game Concept </h3>
Shogun Stand is a 2D tower defense game that offers engaging gameplay mechanics deeply rooted in Japanese mythology. Players will strategically build, upgrade, and deploy various attack units inspired by historical Japanese warriors, such as samurai, archers, and ninjas, to fend off waves of mythical enemies including Yokai, Oni, and Tengu.

The game is based on the arcade style, that means if the player's health is 0 then he has to start the game all over again.

The game features a diverse array of defense towers, each with unique abilities that can be enhanced through a skill tree system.

Players must carefully select the optimal combination of units and towers to exploit enemy weaknesses and synergize with their own strategy.

During gameplay, players will face intense boss fights that challenge their tactical skills and resource management. 

After defeating each boss, players are rewarded with a buff item to strengthen their defenses and a debuff item which will offer them an advantage over the tough enemies.
Shogun Stand also incorporates a progression system where players can unlock new units, towers, and abilities, allowing them to develop their own unique playstyles.

Embrace the challenge and test your strategic prowess in Shogun Stand, where captivating Japanese elements and dynamic game mechanics come together to create an unforgettable tower defense adventure


<h3> What is a Tower Defense game? </h3>
The tower defense genre is a subgenre of strategy video games that revolves 
around defending a designated area, typically a base or a path, from waves
of incoming enemies. 
Players strategically place various types of defensive structures, 
often referred to as "towers," along the enemies' path to obstruct, damage, or 
eliminate them before they reach their objective.
Each tower has unique abilities, strengths, and weaknesses, requiring players 
to carefully plan their strategy and make tactical decisions to counter different 
enemy types. As players progress, they earn in-game resources to upgrade or purchase 
new towers, enhancing their defenses against increasingly challenging enemy waves.
Tower defense games are known for their addictive gameplay, strategic depth, 
and often for their distinctive visual styles.


<h3> Art style and aesthetics Game world and level design </h3>

The game will feature pixelated graphics, but not simplified it should leave much to interpret to the user but give
enough information to tell the user the story, setting, game style and most importantly what's going on
while providing textures which are easy on performance which will allow many units to appear on screen without having
to render many highly complex enemies.

cultural japanese vibe which the game will take place in. (see more info in appendix)

The world and level design being the same will feature a standard style of japanese forest. This can include things
such as rivers, cherry blossom trees and a handful of traditional architecture. The level will contain a winding path on which
enemies will pass to reach your castle.

<h1>Appendix</h1>


<h3>Japanese Time Periods</h3>

<h4>Sengoku Period</h4>

The sengoku jidai (Warring states era) takes place during most of the 15th and 16th century.
This period consisted of many small and large clans vying to take control of territory.

<h4>Edo Period</h4>

The edo jidai, ranging from 1603 to 1867. Coming directly after the warring states era, the country was unified
by the three great unifiers of Japan (In order: Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Tokugawa Ieyasu), which started this era. The edo
period brought 250 years of stability, economic growth, arts and culture.

<h4>Meiji Restoration</h4>

The end of the edo period due to an alliance of two reformists, which brought the power back to
the emperor (the shogunate had ruled Japan for the edo period). The emperor opened up japan after its long
isolationist period, this caused an inflow of new technology and culture. This was the most important step into modernization of Japan.
