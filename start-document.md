<h2> Shogun's Stand </h2>

<h3> Introduction </h3>

In 16th century Japan during the Sengoku period, Daimyo X was a powerful lord tasked with stopping a skilled general named Sei Shapu and his army from conquering his castle. X's forces prepared for battle, knowing that failure would result in the execution of X's fiancee Yumi. After fighting over 100 waves of enemies, Taro emerged victorious and rescued Yumi. The shogun had no choice but to release her unharmed, and X married her in a grand wedding. Taro was hailed as a hero among his people for his bravery and cunning.






<h3> What is a Tower Defense game </h3>
The tower defense genre is a subgenre of strategy video games that revolves around defending a designated area, typically a base or a path, from waves of incoming enemies. Players strategically place various types of defensive structures, often referred to as "towers," along the enemies' path to obstruct, damage, or eliminate them before they reach their objective. Each tower has unique abilities, strengths, and weaknesses, requiring players to carefully plan their strategy and make tactical decisions to counter different enemy types. As players progress, they earn in-game resources to upgrade or purchase new towers, enhancing their defenses against increasingly challenging enemy waves. Tower defense games are known for their addictive gameplay, strategic depth, and often for their distinctive visual styles.
